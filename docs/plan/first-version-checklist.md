# Daythread first version · tracked checklist

Owner: Bumblebee (Product). Created 2026-10-19 from the plan audit (`docs/reviews/plan-audit-2026-10-19-lead.md`).
Scope source: framework r2 §10 "First version", approved by Brian 2026-10-17 (all Settled), plus asks he made
after that (tags on Oct 18). Brian's latest message overrides this file; update it when he changes scope.

## Count

**Built: 7 of 17** (as of main `7f0de2d`, live on 3000, 2026-10-19).

Every status update to Brian quotes this line. Count rule: a row counts as built only when it is live on 3000
**and** has passed review (Ratchet's acceptance task linked in Evidence). "Partial" counts as not built.
Group B is listed for tracking only and never counts toward M.

## How to update

- The author of a change updates the row's Status and Evidence in the same commit as the code, or in a
  docs-only commit right after the deploy. Bumblebee re-checks the count at each deploy.
- Status values: `built` · `partial` · `missing` · `regressed` · `settled` (Brian accepted an alternative).
- Adding or removing a row needs a message from Brian, cited in Source. Team-only deferrals are not allowed.
